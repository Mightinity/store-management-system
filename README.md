#### The Store Inventory Management System (SIMS) stands as a sophisticated apparatus designed for the meticulous orchestration of store management. Boasting advanced reporting functionalities and intricate calculations for gross revenue and net income, SIMS serves as a dynamic platform for effective store oversight. The system seamlessly facilitates the addition of products, complete with corresponding images and barcode integration. Moreover, SIMS introduces a dedicated cashier role to ensure a seamless customer service experience. Going beyond conventional CRUD operations, SIMS distinguishes itself by generating comprehensive monthly reports that delve into essential metrics such as gross revenue and net income.
